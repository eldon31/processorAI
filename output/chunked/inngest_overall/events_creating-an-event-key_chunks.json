      "text": "Creating an Event Key\n\"Event Keys\" are unique keys that allow applications to send (aka publish) events to Inngest. When using Event Keys with the\n[Inngest SDK](\\docs\\events)\n, you can configure the\n```\nInngest\n```\nclient in 2 ways:\n1. Setting the key as an [`INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`](\\docs\\sdk\\environment-variables#inngest-event-key) environment variable in your application*\n2. Passing the key as an argument\nCopy Copied\n```\n// Recommended: Set an INNGEST_EVENT_KEY environment variable for automatic configuration:\nconst inngest = new Inngest ({ name : \"Your app name\" });\n\n// Or you can pass the eventKey explicitly to the constructor:\nconst inngest = new Inngest ({ name : \"Your app name\" , eventKey : \"xyz...\" });\n\n// With the Event Key, you're now ready to send data:\nawait inngest .send ({ ... })\n```\n- Our [Vercel integration](\\docs\\deploy\\vercel) automatically sets the [`INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`](\\docs\\sdk\\environment-variables#inngest-event-key) as an environment variable for you\nüôã Event Keys should be unique to a given\n**environment**\n(e.g. production, branch environments) and a specific\n**application**\n(your API, your mobile app, etc.). Keeping keys separated by application makes it easier to manage keys and rotate them when necessary.\nüîê\n**Securing Event Keys**\n- As Event Keys are used to send data to your Inngest environment, you should take precautions to secure your keys. Avoid storing them in source code and store the keys as secrets in your chosen platform when possible.",
