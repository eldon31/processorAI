This means that your code can continue to run even if there are issues like network failures, timeouts, infrastructure outages, and other transient errors.\nKey aspects of Durable Execution include:\n- **State persistance** - Function state is persisted outside of the function execution context. This enables function execution to be resumed from the point of failure on the same *or* different infrastructure.\n- **Fault-tolerance** - Errors or exceptions are caught by the execution layer and are automatically retried. Retry behavior can be customized to handle the accepted number of retries and handle different types of errors.\nIn practice, Durable Execution is implemented in the form of \"durable functions,\" sometimes also called \"durable workflows.\" Durable functions can throw errors or exceptions and automatically retry, resuming execution from the point of failure. Durable functions are designed to be long-running and stateful, meaning that they can persist state across function invocations and retries.",
