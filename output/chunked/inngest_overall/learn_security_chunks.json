By default, the signing key adds the following:\n- **Authentication** : requests to your endpoint are authenticated, ensuring that they originate from Inngest. Inngest SDKs reject all requests that are not authenticated with the signing key.\n- **Replay attack prevention:** requests are signed with a timestamp embedded, and old requests are rejected, even if the requests are authenticated correctly.\n**It's important that the signing key is kept secret.**\nIf your signing key is exposed, it puts the security of your endpoints at risk.

In order to run your functions, they must be\n[synced](\\docs\\apps\\cloud)\n, or registered, with your Inngest account. This is required for Inngest to know which functions your application is serving and the configuration of each function. Syncing functions is done via a secure handshake. Here's how the handshake works:\n1. After your SDK's endpoint is live, a PUT request to the endpoint initiates a secure handshake with the Inngest servers.\n2. The SDK sends function configuration to Inngest's API, with the signing key as a bearer token.\n3. The SDK idempotently updates your apps and functions. If there are no changes, nothing happens.\nThis process is necessary for several reasons, largely as serverless environments are the lowest common denominator. Serverless environments have no default bootup/init process, which means serverless environments can't self-initiate the sync. Secondly, serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda and Vercel create unique URLs for each function deployed, which can't be known ahead of time. The incoming PUT request allows the SDK to introspect the request's URL, which is then used for all function calls.\nNote that because the SDK only sends HTTP requests to\n```\napi.inngest.com\n```\nto complete the sync, it never leaks the signing key to clients attempting registration, keeping your key secure.",
