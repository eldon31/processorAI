You can select multiple run\nstatuses in case your function might have had a bug that failed silently, so you want to replay anything\npreviously marked as \"Succeeded\" as well.\nReplay modal form filled\nOnce you have selected the runs you want to replay, click the replay button to start the replay. You\nwill be redirected to the replay page where you can see the progress of the replay.\nList of all Replays\nThe replay will spread out the runs over time as to not overwhelm your application with requests.\nDepending on the number of runs to be replayed, this could take seconds or minutes to complete.\nWhen all the runs have been replayed, the replay will be marked as \"Completed.\"",
