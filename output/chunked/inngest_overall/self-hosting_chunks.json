Authenticates client requests via [Event Keys](\\docs\\events\\creating-an-event-key?ref=docs-self-hosting) . The Event API publishes event payloads to an internal event stream.\n- **Event stream** - Acts as a buffer between the *Event API* and the *Runner* .\n- \n**Runner**\n- Consumes incoming events and performs several actions:\n- Scheduling of new \"function runs\" (aka jobs) given the event type, creating initial run state in the *State store* database. Runs are added to queues given the function's flow control configuration.\n- Resumes functions paused via [`waitForEvent`](\\docs\\features\\inngest-functions\\steps-workflows\\wait-for-event?ref=docs-self-hosting) with matching expressions.\n- Cancels running functions with matching [`cancelOn`](\\docs\\features\\inngest-functions\\cancellation\\cancel-on-events?ref=docs-self-hosting) expressions.\n- Writes ingested events to a database for historical record and future replay.\n- **Queue** - A multitenant-aware, multitier queue designed for fairness and various [flow control](\\docs\\guides\\flow-control?ref=docs-self-hosting) methods (concurrency, throttling, prioritization, debouncing, rate limiting) and [batching](\\docs\\guides\\batching?ref=docs-self-hosting) .\n- **Executor** - Responsible for executing functions, from initial execution, step execution, writing incremental function run state to the *State store* , and retries after failures.\n- **State store (database)** - Persists data for pending and ongoing function runs. Data includes initial triggering event(s), step output and step errors.\n- **Database** - Persists system data and history including Apps, Functions, Events, Function run results.\n- **API** - GraphQL and REST APIs for programmatic access and management of system resources.\n- **Dashboard UI** - The UI to manage apps, functions and view function run history.\nThe source code for Inngest and all services is\n[available on GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest)\n.",

(See [Using external services](\\docs\\self-hosting#using-external-services) for more information.)\n- Use SQLite for persistence. The default database is located at `./.inngest/main.db` . Queue and state store snapshots are periodically saved to the SQLite database, including prior to shutdown.\n- Disable app sync polling to check for new functions or updated configurations (see `--poll-interval` flag).\nTo securely configure your server, create your event and signing keys using whatever format you choose and start the Inngest server using them. You can also pass them via environment variable (see below):\nThe signing key must be a valid hexadecimal string with an even number of characters. You can generate a secure signing key using:\nCopy Copied\n```\nopenssl rand -hex 32\n```\nCopy Copied\n```\ninngest start --event-key --signing-key\n```\nThen you can use these same keys as environment variables when starting your application (\n```\nINNGEST_EVENT_KEY\n```\nand\n```\nINNGEST_SIGNING_KEY\n```\n).\n[See below](\\docs\\self-hosting#configuring-inngest-sdks-to-use-self-hosted-server)\nfor an example Node.js startup command.\nTo see all the available options, run\n```\ninngest start --help\n```\n:\nCopy Copied\n```\n$ inngest start --help\nNAME:\ninngest start - [Beta] Run Inngest as a single-node service.\n\nUSAGE:\ninngest start [options]\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nExample: inngest start\n\nOPTIONS:\n--config string                                              Path to an Inngest configuration file\n--host string                                                Inngest server hostname\n--port string, -p string                                     Inngest server port (default: \"8288\")\n--sdk-url string, -u string [ --sdk-url string, -u string ]  App serve URLs to sync (ex. http://localhost:3000/api/inngest)\n--signing-key string                                         Signing key used to sign and validate data between the server and apps.\n--event-key string [ --event-key string ]                    Event key(s) that will be used by apps to send events to the server.\n--sqlite-dir string                                          Directory for where to write SQLite database.\n--redis-uri string                                           Redis server URI for external queue and run state.

As this is running within the same process as the Inngest server, running your own Redis server can improve performance and reliability of the system. You may choose to run your own Redis server or use a cloud-based Redis service like AWS ElastiCache, Redis Cloud, etc.\nTo use an external Redis server, set the\n```\nredis-uri\n```\nflag to the Redis server URI.\n**External Postgres database**\nBy default, the Inngest server uses SQLite for persistence. This is convenient for zero-dependency deployments, but does not support scaling beyond a single node. You may choose to run your own Postgres database or use a cloud-based Postgres service like AWS RDS, Neon, Supabase, etc.\nTo use an external Postgres database, set the\n```\npostgres-uri\n```\nflag to your Postgres connection string URI.",
