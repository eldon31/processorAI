When you serve your functions using our serve API handler, you are hosting a new Inngest app. With Inngest apps, your dashboard reflects your code organization better.\n\nIt's important to note that apps are synced to one environment. You can sync any number of apps to one single environment using different Inngest Clients.\n\nThe diagram below shows how each environment can have multiple apps which can have multiple functions each:\n\nDiagram showing multiple environments, each with various apps.

Changing your client ID will result in Inngest not recognizing the app ID during the ne",

In this scenario, you will need to sync your app to inform Inngest that your apps and functions are hosted at `https://myapp.com/api/inngest` .\n\nTo ensure that your functions are up to date, you need to resync your app with Inngest whenever you deploy new function configurations to your hosted platform.\n\nInngest uses the [`INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`](\\docs\\platform\\signing-keys?ref=deploy) to securely communicate with your application and identify the correct environment to sync your app.\n\n## [Next Steps](\\docs\\apps#next-steps)\n\nTo continue your exploration, feel free to check out:\n\n- How to [work with Apps in the Dev Server](\\docs\\local-development#connecting-apps-to-the-dev-server)\n- How to [work with Apps in Inngest Cloud](\\docs\\apps\\cloud)",
