There are four tools available to you via your affiliate account:\n1. Links - Direct URL links to Viator\n2. Widgets - Customizable widgets displaying 1-30 product previews\n3. Banners - Banner ads, available in standard size formats\n4. Affiliate API - API solution to more deeply integrate and customize Viator content\nYour tracking and attribution parameters consist of four elements:\n1. PID: Your nine digit account ID\n2. MCID: An internal tracking ID used by Viator\n3. Medium: The medium used to retrieve a link. Media can be link, widget, banner, and API\n4. Campaign: An optional user-defined code which partners can use to track campaigns and touchpoints",
