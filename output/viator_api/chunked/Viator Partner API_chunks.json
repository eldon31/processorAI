I.e., the answer for \"TRANSFER_PORT_CRUISE_SHIP\" pertains to both questions. There is no provision for the customer to specify different cruise ships for arrival and departure.\n- Please note that the inclusion of the \"TRANSFER_ARRIVAL_MODE\" , \"TRANSFER_DEPARTURE_MODE\" or their corollary conditional booking questions does not necessarily imply that pickup is offered for the product or product option being booked. It may be that these relate to another aspect of the service being offered; for example, an airport greeting product. When returned for a product, these questions must be answered.\n- The \"TRANSFER_ARRIVAL_DROP_OFF\" and \"TRANSFER_DEPARTURE_PICKUP\" questions are related to locations (arrival drop off and departure pickup) however there are no specific location references or conditions that apply to these questions (see the table). Therefore, customers should be provided with a freetext input field for these questions and the answers must include the FREETEXT designation if the customer answered freely, via text.\n- Whether or not pickup is available should be determined at the product level by the value of logistics.travelerPickup.pickupOptionType being either \"PICKUP_EVERYONE\" or \"PICKUP_AND_MEET_AT_START_POINT\" and not \"MEET_EVERYONE_AT_START_POINT\" ; or, the presence of the phrase \"pickup included\" in the productOptions[].description field for the product option.\n- Pickup must be validated on the product option level. It's possible that the product has multiple product options with a different setup for each one - i.e. one product option offers pickup, another product option requires to meet at the meeting point. The correct validation must be applied as described here: How to determine if a product option supports pickup.\n- logistics.travelerPickup.pickupOptionType in the product content response could return \"PICKUP_AND_MEET_AT_START_POINT\" for products that don't have product options. In such cases travelers should be allowed to either select a pickup location, or decide to meet at the meeting point.\n- Pickup locations shouldn't be displayed at checkout for product options without pickup (this includes the option to contact the supplier later).

These instruct the customer to either meet at one of the locations specified in logistics.start[] , or to contact the supplier later to arrange a pickup point, respectively.\nWhen building a list of available pickup locations for the customer to select at the time of booking, the descriptive text for these locations can be used. This is available from the /locations/bulk endpoint in the\nfield, as follows:\n```\n{ \"locations\": [ { \"provider\": \"TRIPADVISOR\", \"reference\": \"CONTACT_SUPPLIER_LATER\", \"name\": \"I will contact the supplier later\" }, { \"provider\": \"TRIPADVISOR\", \"reference\": \"MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT\", \"name\": \"I will meet at the departure point\" } ] }\n```\nOr, you can provide a selection button in your UI, as we have done on the viator.com site:\n```\nThis button appears when the \"CONTACT_SUPPLIER_LATER\" location reference is included in the logistics.travelerPickup.locations[] array.\n```\nHow to determine if a product option supports pickup\nWhen the value of logistics.travelerPickup.pickupOptionType in the product content response is \"PICKUP_AND_MEET_AT_START_POINT\" , it means that the product includes both 'hotel pickup' and\n'meet at the departure point' variants in its product options; e.g., one product option may be for hotel pickup while another is for meeting at the start/departure point.\nTo determine which product options offer what, it is necessary to inspect each product option's details in the productOptions[] array in the product content response.\nIf pickup is included for a product option, the phrase Pickup included will be present in the productOptions[].description field, as well as any other comments provided by the supplier. For example, the following two product options from product 8374P24 both offer pickup:\nWhen booking a product option with pickup included , such as this, you must collect a pickup point from the user that corresponds to one of the entries in the logistics.travelerPickup.locations[] array in the product content response.\nAll booking questions related to arrival/departure must be displayed as normal to allow customers to select the desired arrival/departure mode and provide all relevant information to the supplier before travel.\nAll answers provided by the customer must be captured and submitted in the booking request following the logic for conditional booking questions from the table in the API documentation .\nIf the productOptions[].description field does not contain the phrase Pickup included , this indicates that this product option does not include pickup and should be considered to follow a \"MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT\" arrangement.\nFor example, the following product option (also from product 8374P24 ) requires meeting at the departure point and does not include pickup:\nIn case of product options without pickup, you shouldn't ask arrival or departure-related questions at checkout (but you will still need to answer the questions returned in the API using values hardcoded into your implementation). If you wish, you can display at checkout the meeting point location(s) for informational purposes (not collecting answers) but not the pickup locations and no questions related to arrival/departure should be displayed in that case.\nThe option to contact the supplier later ( \"CONTACT_SUPPLIER_LATER\" ) doesn't apply to this scenario either and should not be present as it applies only to product options with pickup.\nIn the answer to the \"PICKUP_POINT\" question, you will need to send the location reference \"MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT\" (returned under travelerPickup.locations ). In case the product returns the \"TRANSFER_ARRIVAL_MODE\" or \"TRANSFER_DEPARTURE_MODE\" questions, these must be answered with \"OTHER\" . Product examples for testing: 9025P51 , 62450P1 .",

This information is given in the bookingConfirmationSettings object in the product content response .\nExample bookingConfirmationSettings object:\n```\n\"bookingConfirmationSettings\": { \"bookingCutoffType\": \"START_TIME\", \"bookingCutoffInMinutes\": 0, \"confirmationType\": \"INSTANT\" },\n```\nThere are four booking cutoff types, indicated by the value of the bookingCutoffType element; they are:\n- \"START_TIME\" - booking cutoff is relative to the product's start time\n- \"OPENING_TIME\" - booking cutoff is relative to the product's opening time\n- \"CLOSING_TIME\" - booking cutoff is relative to the product's closing time\n- \"FIXED_TIME\" - booking cutoff is relative to the time given in the bookingCutoffFixedTime element\nIn addition, the booking cutoff time may be offset by the number of minutes given in bookingCutoffInMinutes ; for example, product 57377P9's booking cutoff is 120 minutes prior to its start time:\n```\n\"bookingConfirmationSettings\": { \"bookingCutoffType\": \"START_TIME\", \"bookingCutoffInMinutes\": 120, \"confirmationType\": \"INSTANT\" }\n```\nThe availability of products that have a bookingCutoffType of \"START_TIME\" can be determined by inspecting the pricingRecords[].timedEntries[].startTime field in the response from /availability/schedules/{product-code} . This type of product can be booked up until bookingCutoffInMinutes prior to its starting time in the time-zone in which the product operates, which is given in the timeZone field in the product content response .\nThe booking cutoff time for products with a \"FIXED_TIME\" type is that given in the bookingCutoffFixedTime element, offset by the number of minutes given in bookingCutoffInMinutes . In the fixed time scenario, bookingCutoffInMinutes can only be 0, 1440 (24 hours) or 2880 (48 hours). This means that the booking cutoff time is at a certain time on the day on which the product operates; or, at that same time but one or two days before the tour date, respectively.\nIn the following example, the booking cutoff is 10:00am on the day before the tour or activity operates:\n```\n\"bookingConfirmationSettings\": { \"bookingCutoffType\": \"FIXED_TIME\", \"bookingCutoffInMinutes\": 1440, \"confirmationType\": \"INSTANT\", \"bookingCutoffFixedTime\": \"10:00:00\" }\n```\nYou may not be able to book a product (using /bookings/book or /bookings/cart/book ) or place a booking hold on a product using /bookings/hold or /bookings/cart/hold after it is past the booking cutoff time. However, this is not always the case. Always check real-time availability using the /availability/check endpoint.\nNonetheless, in displaying the availability of a product on your site, you may wish to mark products as 'unavailable' for a particular day or starting time if it is presently past the booking cutoff time if you feel that doing so will improve your site's UX.\nHowever, because the availability schedule data in general can rapidly fall out of date, we again encourage you to always utilise the real-time /availability/check endpoint as the primary means to determine and communicate a product's availability in your product booking workflow.",

In this case, you will receive a bookingStatus of \"PENDING\" in the response, which is the expected behavior when making a booking request for a manual-confirmation product.

These are all currently supported destination types, though for some there are no live examples at the moment\nEvery product has one or more destinations associated with it by way of its destination reference. This is given in the destinations object in the response from any of the product content endpoints; e.g.:\n```\n\"destinations\": [ { \"ref\": \"34198\", \"primary\": true } ],\n```\nTo de-reference destination identifiers, you must use our destination taxonomy, which can be retrieved from the /destinations endpoint.\nYou may wish to filter products according to destination.\nA call to /destinations will return data for all available destinations. You must store a local copy of this mapping information, as destination data does not change frequently - i.e., new destinations are rarely added. On-demand updates can be done in the event you encounter a product associated to a destination reference for which you do not have the details.\nExample snippet of destination taxonomy :\n```\n\"latitude\": -8.68877, \"longitude\": 115.161267 } }, { \"destinationId\": 901, \"name\": \"Buenos Aires\", \"type\": \"CITY\", \"parentDestinationId\": 22280, \"lookupId\": \"9.78.22280.901\", \"destinationUrl\": \"https://shop.live.rc.viator.com/x/d901-ttd?mcid=42383&pid=P001 \"defaultCurrencyCode\": \"ARS\", \"timeZone\": \"America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires\", \"iataCode\": \"BUE\", \"center\": { \"latitude\": -34.6084175, \"longitude\": -58.3731613 } }, ...\n```\nNote that destinations are organized into a hierarchy. The destination's position in the hierarchy can be determined according to the parentDestinationId and lookupId fields.\nIn the second example above, Buenos-Aires is a \"CITY\" , and it has a parentDestinationId of 22280 , which is the destinationId of \"The Pampas\" - the \"REGION\" in South America where Buenos-Aires is located.\nThe destination's full lineage with respect to the hierarchy is given in lookupId , which is a series of destination ids separated by periods - in this case:\n```\n\"lookupId\": \"9.78.22280.901\"\n```\n9, Destination name = (unnamed). 9, Destination type = (broad continental designation). 78, Destination name = Argentina. 78, Destination type = \"COUNTRY\". 22280, Destination name = The Pampas. 22280, Destination type = \"REGION\". 901, Destination name = Buenos-Aires. 901, Destination type = \"CITY\"\nUsing this information, you are able to categorize each product into its geographical location for display and search purposes.",

This service takes no parameters and retrieves information for all available tags.\nTo learn more about tags, see this article: Viator tags, explained\nWe recommend you store a local copy of this information, as tags do not change frequently. It is only necessary to re-ingest from this endpoint in the event you encounter a product that references a tag for which you do not have the details.\nAs with destinations, tags are organized into a hierarchy. A tag's relative position within that hierarchy can be determined by tracing back through its parent tag ids, which (if the tag has any) are listed in its parentTagIds element. Each tag can have multiple parent tags, and each tag can eventually be traced back to its parent. Parent tags are tags that have no parents; i.e., they are at the top of the hierachy.\nFor example, tag: 20244 (Sports Lessons) in /products/tags response:\nThe parentTagIds for 20244 - Sports lessons are:\n- 21478 - \"Active & Outdoor Classes\"\n- 21909 - \"Outdoor Activities\"\n- 21915 - \"Classes & Workshops\"\nThese three tags have no parent tags, and are therefore at the top of the hierarchy. Applying this same process to the other tags in the tags array, we can determine the full set of tags for this product, in this case:\n- 21909 - \"Outdoor Activities\"\n- 21478 - \"Active & Outdoor Classes\"\n- 20244 - \"Sports lessons\"\n- 21915 - \"Classes & Workshops\"\n- 21946 - \"Good for avoiding crowds\"\n- 21442 - \"On the water\"\n- 20246 - \"Surfing lessons\"\nBy traversing the hierarchy in this way, we have surfaced seven tags that pertain to this product with different levels of generality; i.e. it is an 'active and outdoor class', and it is a 'sports lesson'. More generally, it is an 'outdoor activity', a class or workshop, and is 'good for avoiding crowds':\nIn this way, you can categorize products for search and recommendation purposes, or to create category display and search buttons as seen on viator.com 'things to do' pages ; e.g.:",

They comprise:\n- AED, ARS, AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CLP , CNY, COP , DKK, EUR, FJD, GBP\n- HKD, IDR, ILS, INR, ISK, JPY, KRW, MXN, MYR, NOK, NZD, PEN, PHP , PLN,\n- RUB, SEK, SGD, THB, TRY, TWD, USD, VND, ZAR\nWhile pricing can be in any of the currencies listed above, payments for bookings can only be made using the following four currencies:\n- GBP (British Pound)\n- EUR (Euros)\n- USD (US Dollars)\n- AUD (Australian dollars)\nIn order that you display the correct price to the user and charge accordingly, it is important that you perform the currency conversion based on the exchange rates given in the response from this endpoint and that these conversion rates are valid at the time of conversion (as given in the expiry field).\nIn doing so, you ensure the amount that you, the merchant, will be invoiced by Viator for this product matches your records. Discrepancies are bound to occur if you perform the calculations using expired exchange rates or those from an alternative source.\nAn additional measure to ensure that you charge your customer accurately is to confirm that the pricing details returned by the /availability/check endpoint (in the billing currency specified in the request) conform to your expectations. The information provided by this service is the definitive source of truth with regard to product pricing.\nNote: If you attempt to use an unsupported currency when making a booking request, you will receive the following error:",
