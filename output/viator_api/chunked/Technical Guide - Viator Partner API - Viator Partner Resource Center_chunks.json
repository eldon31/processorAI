    "content": "a\nWelcome to the Viator Partner Program! In this guide, we'll go through a variety of topics regarding how you can best use the Viator Partner API to display, promote and sell Viator's 300,000+ products on your own website or travel-booking system. For our partners who use the booking functionality we will also discuss how to interact with our booking systems via the Partner API to support your booking/checkout workflow.\nAll documentation pertaining to the Viator Partner API can be found here. If you have any questions about your integration, please reach out to affiliateapi@tripadvisor.com at any time.\nPlease note that which endpoints you are able to access depends on what kind of partner you are - merchant or affiliate (with basic, full, or booking access). Different endpoint access levels can be verified here. This guide includes information about the endpoint access for each partner type. For example, endpoints marked as below would not be accessible by Basicaccess Affiliate:\n⊗ Basic-access Affiliates\n✓ Full-access Affiliates\n✓ Merchants\nFurthermore, in a small number of cases an endpoint accessible to both partner types will behave differently between merchants and affiliates. We will mention these differences in the relevant sections.",

The amount of data returned in a search API request is less than what would be returned using the ingestion model, and\n- therefore there is no need to store any data.

First, you can retrieve and display maximum 50 products and if the customer wants to move to the next page with search results, another request to the search endpoint should be done to request additional products.

These data points about the device, connection, and location are then analyzed to recognize trusted customers and reduce the likelihood of fraudulent bookings.\nNote: Not providing this information will put your transactions at risk of rejection by Viator's fraud prevention tools.\nIn addition to fraud prevention measures from the Viator's Javascript library, affiliate API partners with booking access should use additional fields ( FraudPreventionDetails ) available in the API for fraud prevention. If you work with agencies, agents, or sell through different channels, you should have a way to identify transactions coming from different sources. For\nthat we have the following fields in the additionalBookingDetails schema in the /bookings/cart/book request in the API:\n- subChannelId\n- agencyId\n- agentId\nWhen it comes to identifying high risk transactions, in some cases it matters who will receive the voucher post booking. For this reason, we also ask you to share this information using the voucherDeliveryType field (possible values: EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER, EMAIL_TO_AGENT, EMAIL_TO_CUSTOMER_AND_AGENT).\nLast but not least, if you have a membership program in place it would be useful to collect the information on when the customer making the booking has joined your membership program. You can send the date when the customer joined using the customerMemberSince field.\nAll these fields are available under additionalBookingDetails.FraudPreventionDetails in the /bookings/cart/book, allowing the relevant details to be passed along with the booking request and facilitating the fraud prevention process on the Viator side.\nNote: If a transaction initiated by a specific user is flagged as potentially fraudulent and you do not include unique identifiers for that user, such as the agentId, our fraud prevention tools will implement heightened security measures across your entire account. This may lead to an increase in failed transactions due to fraud concerns. Conversely, if you provide a unique identifier like the agentId, these measures will only affect future transactions made by that user, resulting in fewer booking failures at the account level. Therefore, we strongly recommend utilizing the fraudPreventionDetails when applicable. Though all these steps will facilitate fraud prevention, this does not guarantee that no transactions will be blocked as fraud prevention, it will only improve the process.",

    "content": "- If the productOptions[].description field does not contain the phrase 'Pickup included' , this indicates that this product option does not include pickup and should be considered to follow a 'MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT' arrangement.\nFront-end: In case of product options without pickup, you shouldn't ask arrival or departure-related questions at checkout (but you will still need to answer the questions returned in the API using values hardcoded into your implementation). If you wish, you can display at checkout the meeting point location(s) for informational purposes (not collecting answers) but not the pickup locations and no questions related to arrival/departure should be displayed in that case. The option to contact the supplier later (CONTACT_SUPPLIER_LATER) doesn't apply to this scenario either and should not be present as it applies only to product options with pickup.\nBack-end: In the answer to the PICKUP_POINT question, you will need to send the location reference MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT (returned under travelerPickup.locations). In case the product returns the TRANSFER_ARRIVAL_MODE or TRANSFER_DEPARTURE_MODE questions, these must be answered with OTHER.\nYou can use these instant confirmation type products for testing: 9025P51, 62450P1.\nThis article includes a step-by-step guide on how to validate pickup and apply conditional booking questions correctly: Implementing Booking Questions.",

Most importantly, you will need to make sure that the product option description returned in the API response is clearly visible as it provides guidelines about the meeting point for each product option.\nWhen a product returns the PICKUP_POINT question, in order to book the product option without pickup, or allow the customer to meet at the meeting point instead of selecting the pickup location (for a product option with pickup), you will need\nto answer the PICKUP_POINT question with a special location reference: MEET_AT_DEPARTURE_POINT.\nIn case customers contact you to confirm the meeting point location post booking, you can refer to the meeting point location displayed on their Viator voucher .\nIn case of product 131843P24, the voucher for a booking made for product option TG1 ('CAPRI FROM NAPLES') will include the meeting point location set up by the supplier for the selected product option:",
