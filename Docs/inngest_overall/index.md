# Inngest Documentation

Inngest is an event-driven durable execution platform that allows you to run fast, reliable code on any platform, without managing queues, infra, or state.

Write functions in TypeScript, Python or Go to power background and scheduled jobs, with steps built in.  We handle the backend infra, queueing, scaling, concurrency, throttling, rate limiting, and observability for you.
