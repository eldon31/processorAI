# Provider

A deep dive into the provider for streaming agents

The `AgentProvider` is a React component that creates a shared context for all `useAgent` hooks in your application. While it's optional, using it is highly recommended as it improves performance and ensures configuration consistency.

## [ Why Use the Provider?](#why-use-the-provider%3F)

By wrapping your agent-driven components in `AgentProvider` , you get several key benefits:

- **Performance** : A single WebSocket connection is established and shared across all components, reducing network overhead.
- **Consistency** : A shared transport configuration, user context, and channel key are used by all hooks, preventing inconsistencies.
- **Flexibility** : Individual hooks can still override the shared configuration if needed for specific cases.
- **Anonymous Users** : The provider automatically generates and persists a unique ID for anonymous users, allowing them to have a consistent experience across page loads.

## [ How It Works](#how-it-works)

`AgentProvider` creates a React Context that provides a shared transport instance, connection, and user information to any `useAgent` hook rendered within it. The hooks will automatically detect and use the context if it's available.

If you don't use the provider, each `useAgent` hook will create its own transport and connection, which is less efficient.

## [ Usage Patterns](#usage-patterns)

Here are some common ways to use the `AgentProvider` .

### [ Basic Authenticated User](#basic-authenticated-user)

For an application with logged-in users, pass the user's unique ID to the `userId` prop. This ensures that the agent's context is tied to the correct user.

Copy Ask AI

```
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent" ;
import { ChatPage } from "./ChatPage" ;
import { ThreadsSidebar } from "./ThreadsSidebar" ;

function App ({ userId }) {
return (
< AgentProvider userId = { userId } >
< ChatPage />
< ThreadsSidebar />
</ AgentProvider >
);
}
```

### [ Anonymous Users](#anonymous-users)

If your application supports guest users, you can omit the `userId` prop. The provider will automatically create a unique anonymous ID and store it in `sessionStorage` to maintain a consistent experience for the user during their session.

Copy Ask AI

```
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent" ;
import { GuestChatInterface } from "./GuestChatInterface" ;

function App () {
return (
< AgentProvider >
< GuestChatInterface />
</ AgentProvider >
);
}
```

### [ Collaborative Sessions](#collaborative-sessions)

To create shared, collaborative sessions (e.g., a chat where multiple users interact with the same agent in a shared context), you can use the `channelKey` prop. All users who connect with the same `channelKey` will be subscribed to the same real-time channel.

Copy Ask AI

```
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent" ;
import { CollaborativeChat } from "./CollaborativeChat" ;

function ProjectChat ({ projectId }) {
return (
< AgentProvider channelKey = { `project- ${ projectId } ` } >
< CollaborativeChat />
</ AgentProvider >
);
}
```

### [ Custom Transport Configuration](#custom-transport-configuration)

You can customize the HTTP endpoints and headers used by the transport layer by passing a configuration object to the `transport` prop. This is useful if your API routes don't follow the default conventions.

Copy Ask AI

```
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent" ;

function App ({ userId , getAuthToken }) {
return (
< AgentProvider
userId = { userId }
transport = { {
api: {
sendMessage: '/api/v2/chat' ,
fetchThreads: '/api/v2/threads'
},
headers : () => ({
'Authorization' : `Bearer ${ getAuthToken () } ` ,
})
} }
>
< ChatApp />
</ AgentProvider >
);
}
```
