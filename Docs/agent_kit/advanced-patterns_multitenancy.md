# Configuring Multi-tenancy

Configure capacity based on users or organizations.

As discussed in the [deployment guide](\concepts\deployment) , moving an AgentKit network into users' hands requires configuring usage limits.

To avoid having one user's usage affect another, you can configure multi-tenancy.

Multi-tenancy consists of configuring limits based on users or organizations ( *called "tenants"* ).

It can be easily configured on your AgentKit network using Inngest.

**Prerequisites** Your AgentKit network [must be configured with Inngest](\getting-started\local-development#1-install-the-inngest-package) .

## [ Configuring Multi-tenancy](#configuring-multi-tenancy)

Adding multi-tenancy to your AgentKit network is done by transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function.

### [ Transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function](#transforming-your-agentkit-network-into-an-inngest-function)

First, you'll need to create an Inngest Client:

src/inngest/client.ts Copy Ask AI

```
import { Inngest } from "inngest" ;

const inngest = new Inngest ({
id: "my-agentkit-network" ,
});
```

Then, transform your AgentKit network into an Inngest function as follows:

src/inngest/agent-network.ts Copy Ask AI

```
import { createAgent , createNetwork , openai } from "@inngest/agent-kit" ;
import { createServer } from "@inngest/agent-kit/server" ;

import { inngest } from "./inngest/client" ;

const deepResearchAgent = createAgent ({
name: "Deep Research Agent" ,
tools: [
/* ... */
],
});

const network = createNetwork ({
name: "My Network" ,
defaultModel: openai ({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
agents: [ deepResearchAgent ],
});

const deepResearchNetworkFunction = inngest . createFunction (
{
id: "deep-research-network" ,
},
{
event: "deep-research-network/run" ,
},
async ({ event , step }) => {
const { input } = event . data ;
return network . run ( input );
}
);

const server = createServer ({
functions: [ deepResearchNetworkFunction ],
});

server . listen ( 3010 , () => console . log ( "Agent kit running!" ));
```

The `network.run()` is now performed by the Inngest function.

Don't forget to register the function with `createServer` 's `functions` property.

### [ Configuring a concurrency per user](#configuring-a-concurrency-per-user)

We can now configure the capacity by user by adding concurrency and throttling configuration to our Inngest function:

src/inngest/agent-network.ts Copy Ask AI

```
import { createAgent , createNetwork , openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit' ;
import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server' ;

import { inngest } from './inngest/client' ;

// network and agent definitions..

const deepResearchNetworkFunction = inngest . createFunction ({
id: 'deep-research-network' ,
concurrency: [
{
key: "event.data.user_id" ,
limit: 10 ,
},
],
}, {
event: "deep-research-network/run"
}, async ({ event , step }) => {
const { input } = event . data ;

return network . run ( input );
})

const server = createServer ({
functions: [ deepResearchNetworkFunction ],
});

server . listen ( 3010 , () => console . log ( "Agent kit running!" ));
```

Your AgentKit network will now be limited to 10 concurrent requests per user.

The same can be done to add [throttling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/throttling?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy) , [rate limiting](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/rate-limiting?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy) or [priority](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/priority?ref=agentkit-docs-multitenancy) .
